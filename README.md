### Hi! I'm Sam Alafar ðŸš€

MERN Full Stack Web Developer, fascinated about new technologies, web development, good and clean code practices.

Recently graduated from Ironhack Barcelona after an immersive 9 week intensive web development bootcamp.
I'm self-demanding on my own projects, always aiming for the best result. A detailed-oriented person that is always trying to find the best way to improve any given problem.
I also love helping others to achieve their targets by optimising and amplifying their performance while turning their abstract ideas into practical solutions and detailed structures.
I'd love to work on any kind of project on the web development field, as well as I'm eager to find a job position in a well stablished company or any start-up with a high growth potential.
I love to spend my free time on playing music, practicing sports which is my other passion like running, swimming, cycling and tennis.
